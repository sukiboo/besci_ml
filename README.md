# BeSci + ML
An ambitious project of combining machine learning and behavioral science.

The current code uses NHANES dataset and builds a simulator using additional behavioral rules.
In this formlulation the input consist of 6 demographic features: age, gender, race, income, education, marital status.
The output is a 5-dimensional probability vector of food preferences.
The resulting simulator is non-deterministic and synthesizes data that alignes with the underlying behavioral rules.
